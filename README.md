hey,

my name is dan, and welcome to my github page. you won't find anything too interesting here, but here's some info about myself:

i'm a college student at UC Santa Barbara, majoring in mathematics. i used to do a lot of programming in Lua on Roblox during middle school and some of high school, but i've since moved on and tried to branch out. i haven't really been doing as much programming as i used to these past few years, but it is definitely still a strong passion of mine. in the future, i hope to work in a computing related field, such as machine learning or software engineering, but i've also considered research and teaching.

you might be wondering (probably not) why i'm a math major instead of a computer science major if i have a strong desire to be with computers. well i'm glad you asked: mathematics is my absolute favorite subject. being able to quantify situations and phenomena into regular formulas and numbers is really fascinating to me, but even beyond that, i feel a connection to mathematics. without having to sound very spiritual, i believe it's the way in which we can understand the deeper order of the universe; how in spite of all the chaos we may be experiencing and how everything may seem to fall a part, there will always be something in tact, something that will be permanent. in some ways i'm echoing the same desires of ancient civilizations, how they want to leave a permanent mark (see stone structures) on the world and connect themselves to the deeper order of the cosmos. in a way, i want to leave my own mark on this world, something that will alter the continuation of events. i don't necessarily want to become well-known or famous, but rather that i want to be the reason why things are happening the way they are. for this reason, i want to do my best and be my best, because if i can die knowing that i've made this world a better place, then i can say that i've achieved my life's purpose.

anyways, that's a tangent that's very loosely connected to mathematics, but the sentiment i'm trying to convey is the reason why i love math is because it's the way in which we understand the deeper order of the universe, and how we can find connections to things seemingly unrelated to each other. it's also just a really cool field to me, how it's almost universally applicable. with computing in particular, programming honestly feels like an applied mathematical proof; showing every step of the way and ensuring that it all makes sense and holds. i guess that's why i'm attracted to it üòâ.

you probably weren't expecting a philisophical rant in an "about me" section on github, but enjoy it nonetheless. bear in mind that i did write this at 2 in the morning.

if you wish to contact me, here's some of my contact info:

**Discord**: Dan Le Man 2#1890
**Steam**: [Dan Le Man üêç](https://steamcommunity.com/id/danleepicman/)

i have other accounts but i don't check those often; steam and discord are the ones i frequent the most. feel free to add me for whatever reason: i love meeting new people and would love to talk with you about anything!
